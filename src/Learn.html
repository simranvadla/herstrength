            <h3 style="color:darkslateblue">Girls Power Education</h3>
            <p>Ensuring that all girls and young women receive a quality education is their human right, a global development priority, and a strategic priority for the World Bank. Girlsâ€™ education goes beyond getting girls into school. It is also about ensuring that girls learn and feel safe while in school; have the opportunity to complete all levels of education, acquiring the knowledge and skills to compete in the labor market; gain socio-emotional and life skills necessary to navigate and adapt to a changing world; make decisions about their own lives; and contribute to their communities and the world.</p>
